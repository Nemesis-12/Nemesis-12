#### ABOUT ME
A passionate college student aiming to help as many people as he can. I love playing video games, with my favorite genre being RPGs, chess, anime, soccer and, of course, programming. Some of the technologies that I currently work with are Python, C++, C#, HTML and CSS. I am constantly trying my best to learn as many new programming languages as I can.
